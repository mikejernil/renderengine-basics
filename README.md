### 3D Gaussian Splatting through Render Engine - First Principles ‚ú®

<img width="855" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-01 at 12 16 41 PM" src="https://github.com/mikejernil/web-render-engine/assets/43872457/8c19c7dd-9253-43c9-a45d-0a3fc80a2c2d">

With the latest advancements in Computer Graphics, there is a new Pandora's box that has been opened called - **'3D Gaussian Splatting'**. It works on the concept that real world scenes could be efficiently represented as 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) - as an alternative to Traditional Mesh representation which involves - Mesh, Textures, Lighting etc.

This 3DGS representation has the primary advantage that huge real-world scenes which are otherwise generated by classic photogrammetry & complex to render using traditional computer graphics techniques can now be represented as 3D Gaussian Splats, which you can imagine as 3D paint strokes with a centered color and transparency values around the center, which also takes into account from where/how the scene is being viewed (aka the Camera). When multiple of these strokes are rendered with proper blending of alpha transparency from each splat, it can form a near realistic 3D image that can be viewed from any angle. üîÆ

## Get Started üì∫

### Clone Repo

Use `git clone <repo-link>` to clone the repo to your PC

### Install the Packages

Use `npm i` to install the necessary packages

### Run the 3D Viewer

Use `npm run dev` to run the viewer in development mode

### Viewer

Now you can see the Render Engine running on `http://localhost:5173`. You can navigate, interact & play around with the 3D Assets!
