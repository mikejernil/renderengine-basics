# Render Engine Basics - Series

Tutorial series for creating 3D render engines on the Web for Real-time rendering of any dataset from Vector tiles, 3D maps to city-scale 3D meshes, point clouds &amp; Gaussian Splats.

‚≠êÔ∏è More than building a Render engine from scratch, this series is to help you understand the Core components / First principles of a Render engine so you can build your own Render engine pipelines for any application end-to-end! 

üßä If you're interested in learning more about building Render Engines, Star/follow this repository. I'll be updating this page starting from the next post in the series!

## Roadmap
1. Creating a Web based 3D Renderer from Scratch (not so much from scratch, we'll be using libraries as this is not the focus of this series)
2. Integrating a minimal GLTF asset viewer
3. Building a Point cloud viewer that can stream and render large city-scale point clouds
4. Building a 3D tiles viewer that can stream and render huge 3D textured meshes
5. Building a 3D Gaussian Splat viewer that can render 3D Gaussian splats (generated by either Luma AI or Polycam)

For each of these steps, we will follow a step-by-step process of using the First principles approach to take each decision, from architectural to spatial data structures, rendering, cloud storage etc.
